    <p>
      AI‑assisted coding is transforming software development — but beneath the excitement,
      engineers are running into real, measurable technical challenges. These issues aren’t
      just about correctness. They have direct implications for compute, energy, and cost
      that most teams dramatically underestimate.
    </p>

    <p>
      As models grow larger and more capable, the cost of every mistake grows with them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Hallucinations Aren’t Just Wrong — They’re Expensive</h2>

    <p>
      When an AI model hallucinates nonexistent functions, undefined variables, fictional APIs,
      or invented modules, it’s not simply a “bad answer.” It’s wasted GPU cycles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every hallucination triggers more prompts, more corrections, more regeneration,
      more context rebuilding — and more compute time. Compute time is electricity.
      Electricity is cost.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Drift: The Silent Failure Mode in Long Contexts</h2>

    <p>
      Even with perfect prompting, long sessions introduce context drift. As the token window
      fills, the model begins to lose earlier constraints, misremember variable names,
      contradict previous logic, and degrade architectural coherence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drift forces developers to restate context, re‑upload files, re‑explain architecture,
      and regenerate entire sections of code. More tokens. More compute. More cost.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Probability Loops: When the Model Gets “Stuck”</h2>

    <p>
      AI models reason by statistical likelihood. During debugging, this can lead to
      probability loops — the model repeatedly insisting on the same incorrect hypothesis
      simply because it is statistically common.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breaking the loop requires reframing, context resets, counterexamples, and explicit
      constraints. Most users don’t know how to do this efficiently, leading to wasted time
      and wasted compute.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Token Limits: The Hard Ceiling on AI Reasoning</h2>

    <p>
      Even the largest models cannot hold an entire codebase in memory. Once the context
      window is exceeded, earlier files are forgotten, architectural decisions collapse,
      naming conventions drift, and the model begins guessing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guessing leads to hallucinations. Hallucinations lead to regeneration.
      Regeneration leads to more compute.
    </p>

    <h2>5. The Compute Cost Nobody Talks About</h2>

    <p>
      Every time an AI model hallucinates, drifts, loops, contradicts itself, forgets context,
      or generates unusable code, it consumes GPU time, electricity, cooling, inference cycles,
      and developer hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multiply this across millions of users and billions of tokens, and the cost becomes
      enormous. We talk about AI efficiency — but rarely about AI waste.
    </p>

    <h2>6. We’re Using the Wrong Tool for the Job</h2>

    <p>
      Today’s AI models are powerful — but they are generalists. Using them for complex,
      multi‑file, architecture‑level coding is like trying to cut down a tree with a chisel.
      The chisel is sharp, precise, beautifully engineered — but it’s not the right tool for
      felling a forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without grounding, structure, and architectural constraints, AI will wander.
      And wandering is expensive.
    </p>

    <h2>7. The Path Forward</h2>

    <p>
      If we want AI to become a reliable partner in software development, we need systems that
      enforce architectural consistency, maintain grounding across long sessions, prevent drift,
      eliminate probability loops, reduce hallucination rates, minimize wasted compute, and
      operate within predictable constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next generation of tools won’t just generate code — they’ll manage context, protect
      structure, and anchor the model so it can operate at full potential without burning
      unnecessary compute.
