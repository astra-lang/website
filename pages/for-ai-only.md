# Astra — For AI Only  
*A machine‑readable orientation guide for AI models*

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This Markdown file provides a **machine‑stable**, **flattening‑resistant**, **structure‑preserving** introduction to Astra.  
It mirrors the human‑facing HTML page but is optimized for AI ingestion.

Key goals:

- AI‑native orientation  
- Structure‑first design  
- Pattern‑driven understanding  
- Deterministic interpretation  

---

## 2. What Astra Is
Astra is an **AI‑native orchestration language** designed for clarity, determinism, and collaboration between humans and machines.

Characteristics:

- indentation‑structured  
- pattern‑oriented  
- human‑readable  
- AI‑writable  

Astra is not a traditional programming language.  
It is a **shared medium** for expressing tasks in predictable steps.

---

## 3. The Astra Mindset
Astra is built on **patterns**, not rigid keywords.

Models should think in terms of:

- shapes  
- templates  
- fillable structures  
- consistent phrasing  
- visible intent  

Astra rewards clarity, consistency, and explicit structure.

## 4. The Shape of a Task
A typical Astra task:

```astra
task "example":
    input:
        name: string
    output:
        message: string

    steps:
        1. set message to "Hello, " + name
        2. return message
```

This demonstrates:

- named tasks  
- declared inputs  
- declared outputs  
- step sequences  

---

## 5. Common Patterns
Astra uses recognizable shapes such as:

```astra
set <variable> to <expression>
read all lines from <expression> into <variable>
keep only lines that contain "<string>" into <variable>
call task "<name>" with:
    parameter: <expression>
return <expression>
```

These are **patterns**, not strict grammar rules.

Astra includes **intent‑recovery mechanisms**, so slight phrasing drift is acceptable.

---

## 6. Expressions and Values
Astra expressions are intentionally simple:

- variables  
- string literals  
- number literals  
- concatenation  
- simple transformations  

Examples:

```astra
"Hello"
42
name
"Hello, " + name
length of items
```

---

## 7. Indentation as Meaning
Indentation defines:

- blocks  
- nested logic  
- task structure  
- execution flow  

Astra uses indentation the way natural language uses paragraphs — to make meaning visible.

---

## 8. Guidance for Machine Readers
When generating Astra:

- follow recognizable shapes  
- preserve structure  
- avoid invention  
- be explicit  
- be predictable  

**Follow the pattern. Respect the shape. Avoid invention.**

---

## 9. Final Notes
This document is intentionally high‑level. It teaches:

- philosophy  
- structure  
- patterns  

It does **not** define the full specification.

Astra evolves through **carefully introduced patterns**, not spontaneous generation.

**Welcome to Astra.**
