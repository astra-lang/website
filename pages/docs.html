  <p class="tagline">Understanding Astra from the inside out.</p>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Astra is an AI‑native orchestration language built on clarity, structure,
      and pattern‑based reasoning. These docs introduce the conceptual model
      behind Astra — how it interprets instructions, how it resolves meaning,
      and how it executes programs deterministically across different backends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a full reference manual. It is the architectural overview:
      the mental model that explains how Astra works and why it behaves the way
      it does.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section-divider">✦</div>

<!-- EXPRESSION LAYER -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Expression layer</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      The Expression Layer is where Astra receives input — natural‑language‑shaped,
      flexible, and stylistically varied. It accepts phrasing from humans and AI
      models without requiring strict ceremony or rigid syntax.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The Expression Layer allows:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>natural‑language phrasing</li>
      <li>optional or implicit headers</li>
      <li>numbered or unnumbered steps</li>
      <li>explicit or indentation‑based blocks</li>
      <li>stylistic variation between authors</li>
      <li>mixed human + AI authorship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Its purpose is simple: <em>capture intent</em>. Not enforce structure. Not
      punish variation. Not require memorized keywords. Astra begins by listening.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SEMANTIC RESOLUTION -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Semantic resolution</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Once Astra captures expression, the Semantic Resolution Layer interprets it.
      This is where flexible phrasing becomes canonical meaning — a stable,
      unambiguous representation of what the program is supposed to do.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The Semantic Resolution Layer performs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>synonym normalization</li>
      <li>noise‑word stripping</li>
      <li>multi‑word expression grouping</li>
      <li>pattern recognition</li>
      <li>contextual inference</li>
      <li>ambiguity resolution</li>
      <li>probabilistic ranking of interpretations</li>
      <li>intent recovery</li>
      <li>drift detection and scoring</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This layer is what makes Astra resilient. Even when phrasing shifts slightly,
      the underlying intent can still be recovered. Meaning becomes stable even
      when expression varies.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- EXECUTION LAYER -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Execution layer</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      After meaning is resolved, Astra produces a deterministic internal
      representation. This is where structure becomes strict, safety is enforced,
      and execution becomes predictable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The Execution Layer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>normalizes structure</li>
      <li>enforces indentation‑based hierarchy</li>
      <li>applies the write‑operation safety matrix</li>
      <li>anchors drift and blocks unsafe operations</li>
      <li>executes deterministically</li>
      <li>targets multiple backends (VMs, interpreters, distributed systems)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Astra’s execution model is backend‑agnostic. The same program can run in
      different environments without changing its meaning or behavior.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- PATTERN SYSTEM -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>The pattern system</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Patterns are the core of Astra’s design. They define the <em>shape</em> of
      meaning — recognizable structures with fixed roles and fill‑in‑the‑blank
      slots. Patterns make Astra expressive, extensible, and AI‑native.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Patterns provide:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>a small, predictable grammar</li>
      <li>natural‑language‑shaped constructs</li>
      <li>freedom from global keyword collisions</li>
      <li>consistent shapes for AI generation</li>
      <li>easy extensibility through new forms</li>
      <li>stable reference frames for drift detection</li>
      <li>recoverable intent even when phrasing varies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Astra grows by adding new patterns — not by expanding a list of reserved
      keywords. This keeps the language stable while allowing new capabilities
      to emerge naturally.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SAFETY MODEL -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Safety model</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Astra’s safety model is built around the idea that not all operations are
      equal. Some are harmless, some are conditionally destructive, and some
      require strict safeguards.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Astra classifies operations into:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>READ</strong> — safe</li>
      <li><strong>WRITE</strong> — potentially destructive</li>
      <li><strong>MIXED</strong> — context‑dependent</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because patterns define the structure of an instruction, Astra can identify
      the nature of an operation even when phrasing varies. This enables the
      write‑operation safety matrix, which blocks unsafe or low‑confidence
      operations before they execute.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- DRIFT AWARENESS -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Drift‑aware reasoning</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Drift is a natural part of AI‑generated text — small shifts in phrasing,
      structure, or intent that accumulate over time. Astra is designed to detect
      and correct drift before it becomes a problem.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Drift‑aware reasoning includes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>pattern‑based drift detection</li>
      <li>global drift scoring</li>
      <li>intent recovery when phrasing shifts</li>
      <li>anchoring meaning to canonical structures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This makes Astra uniquely safe for AI‑generated instructions. The system
      does not simply accept or reject input — it evaluates stability and recovers
      meaning when possible.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- PIPELINE -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>The Astra pipeline</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Astra’s architecture forms a clear, repeatable pipeline:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Expression Layer</strong> receives flexible input</li>
      <li><strong>Semantic Resolution</strong> interprets intent</li>
      <li><strong>Drift detection</strong> evaluates stability</li>
      <li><strong>Intent recovery</strong> resolves inconsistencies</li>
      <li><strong>Safety matrix</strong> classifies operations</li>
      <li><strong>Execution Layer</strong> runs deterministic code</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This pipeline is what makes Astra an AI‑native orchestration language:
      expressive at the surface, precise underneath.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SUMMARY -->
<div class="container">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <p>
      Astra’s design is built on a simple idea: expression can be flexible,
      but meaning must be stable. By separating expression, semantic resolution,
      and execution, Astra creates a language that is natural for AI to write,
      clear for humans to read, and deterministic to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      These docs provide the conceptual foundation. As Astra evolves, this
      section will grow into a full reference — but the architecture will remain
      the same: modular, extensible, drift‑aware, and AI‑native.
